# Reinforcement-Learning
This code is aimed at implementing a value iteration algorithm which is mentioned in Andrew Ng's CS229 machine learning lecture. In this program, uesr can customize the size of the grid map(max 5*5)and set default values. This algorithm is very helpful for understanding value iterations.
